#  OpenCV Practice Projects (Python)

Welcome to my personal OpenCV practice repository! This project is part of my journey to **master computer vision** using **OpenCV** and Python.

I am practicing **daily** to build a strong foundation in computer vision, which is a core part of my field of interest. This hands-on learning approach helps me understand how image and video data is processed, analyzed, and used in real-world AI and automation applications.

---

##  Objective

-  To master OpenCV for **Computer Vision** tasks.
-  Build hands-on skills through **daily coding practice**.
-  Understand how OpenCV handles images, videos, and object detection.
-  Prepare myself for real-world applications like face recognition, object tracking, and AI automation.

##  Project Structure (Day-by-Day Practice)

| Day     | Topics Covered |
|---------|----------------|
| **Day 01** | Basic image operations (read, display, write) |
| **Day 02** | Image transformation (resize, flip, rotate, crop) |
| **Day 03** | Drawing shapes and text on images |
| **Day 04** | Real-time video capture and saving |
| **Day 05** | Image blurring and smoothing techniques |
| **Day 06** | Edge detection using Canny and image thresholding |
| **Day 07** | (Custom or reserved for new concepts) |
| **Day 08** | Contour detection and analysis |
| **Day 09** | Face, eye, and smile detection using Haar cascade classifiers |

---

##  Highlights

-  Face detection using pre-trained Haar cascades
-  Image processing with OpenCV’s powerful built-in functions
-  Real-time video feed handling and object tracking
-  Clear day-by-day structured progression
-  Consistent and self-motivated daily practice

##  Requirements

Make sure you have Python and OpenCV installed:

```bash
pip install opencv-python



# OpenCV Daily Practice – Computer Vision Journey

## How to Run

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adeel-Khan11/Opencv_practise.git
cd Opencv_practise
```

Navigate into any day's folder and run the relevant Python file.  
Example for face detection:

```bash
cd "day 09"
python face_object_detection.py
```

Follow the terminal menu for mode selection (face only, face + eyes, face + eyes + smile).

## Haar Cascades

These XML files are used for object detection in **Day 09**:

- `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`
- `haarcascade_eye.xml`
- `haarcascade_smile.xml`

All are pre-trained classifiers provided by OpenCV.

## My Learning Journey

I created this repository to:

- Reinforce my concepts through consistent daily practice
- Work toward becoming skilled in AI-powered computer vision
- Build a strong portfolio that reflects my hands-on experience
- Prepare for future projects, internships, and jobs involving OpenCV, AI, and ML

Whether it's for academic, professional, or personal growth — I'm using this as a building block for more advanced AI systems.
